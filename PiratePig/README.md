# The Legend

Two chests. One filled with gold, the other silver. A black bag in one of them ... filled with the famed black pearls.

WHen they open the gold chest is is filled to the brim with kernels/seeds <??> Gold corn. The other with silver queen corn (the gold and silver). The real gold and silver is buried beneath the kernels ... about half full and topped with the kernels.

Peg leg. Ship: The Flying Pig (flag is a pig with wings). Red Back was one eyed -- he had a left
eye. This comes into play when they solve a riddle on the map.

  - Meeting in a tavern
  - Treasure is Captain Red Back's fabled treasure
  - Bill McKracken killed Red Back, but Piggie has the map
  - Hires crew. McKracken's descendants come to the meeting and plan to steal the map. The son manages
    to join them (we find out who he is later) but he is suspicious the whole trip.
  
  - Treasure is on an uncharted island southwest of Jamaica. The crew will stop there for supplies.
  
  - End: Piggie and Hazel trade Crew 1 for his home and farm on Tortuga for the Flying Pig. Popcorn farm.

# Snippets 

It was dark and musty in the Dancing Boar Tavern. The light from the fire danced on his red mane casting shaddows like trees on the wall.

"Wait. Did you dye your hair for this story?" Hazel asked. Piggie looked up from the computer. "I did. It's my story and I can tell
it the way I want. Would you like a new color?" "No ... normal old gray is fine."

Hazel sat beside him licking her normal old gray hair.
