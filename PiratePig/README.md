# Scenes

## The Dancing Boar
Piggie and Hazel at a dark tavern known as The Dancing Boar in a pirate town on the southern coast
of Tortuga. Looking over a dusty map. They have bought a small ship, and they've put out word looking 
for a crew to seek a fabulous treasure -- meeting tonight. 

Six men arrive. Two end up leaving (these are McKracken's son and grandson we find out later). The
older has a colorful parrot that chatters.

The legendary treasure of Captain Red Back burried in a cave in the Carribean. Piggie's
great granddad was cook for Back. Pirate Bill McKracken attacked Back to get the location of the treasure. 
Back gave his map to Piggie's great granddad. The crew was killed and the boat was sunk, but Great escaped
with the map. The map passed to Piggie's granddad, and when he died Piggie got the map. The map
shows the route to the island through the treacherous reefs. And then describes how to find the
treasure.

He unrolls it on the table. Treasure is a single chest of silver and gold (ends up being Silver Queen and
Golden Bantam corn) and a small red bag of black pearls (popcorn). The real gold/silver is beneath the
corn. The crew can split the chest. Piggie and Hazel only want the black pearls.

End of the scene is the BAD GUYs leaving. They saw enough of the map to know that the map begins at
Port Royal in Jamaica. They'll attack there and get the map.

## The Gizzard

Also known as The Grinder. A 5 square mile oval patch of hundreds of mini islands, some 50 feet high. Sheer cliffs
and gnarly passages. No beaches. High waves and currents and winds. Some islands just below the surface. Called
The Grinder because it chews up any ships that try to enter. Only a small ship can navigate the passages. But what
fool would brave the waves in a small boat?

The map leads them to the entry point island (specific shape). Then to the next and so on to the treasure. You have
to go in at high tide to avoid the submersed rocks. Once you are at the destination, you have to wait for low tide
to reveal the cave. The cave passage leads up inside the island above sea-level where the threasure chest is hidden.
Then wait for high tide and take the passage out. Have to take a row boat on the last island hop.

Our heros are nearing the destination and spot the McKracken ship in the distance as they board the row boat. They
leave one sailor behind to watch the ship. It is the McKracken son. They are watching ... waiting for the heros to 
bring the treasure out and then steal it from them. Piggie has an idea (we don't discover it). Piggie says they
don't know how to get in, and they can outrun them once they are out. McKracken son sends the map via the parrot.
Or maybe a copy of the map. The reader catches him making the copy earlier.

The heros find the chest, but Piggie doesn't want them to open it until they are back on the ship. He insists they
don't open it (part of the plan). They find an opening onto the island that lets them get back to the ship while
the tide is up. When they get back to the ship, they find the McKrackens with guns drawn. They haul the crew and
the chest on board.

## One Man's Trash

They open the chest and open the black bag. It is popcorn. Then they open the next bag of "silver" ... silver queen
corn. And a gold one ... more corn. McKracken laughs ... tells the crew that they have been suckerd ... that piggie
knew all along this was the treasure. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Piggie is all excited by the
corn.

They open the bag of 
pearls ... popcorn. Try another chest. Break open a bag of silver -- corn. Another chest. The same.
"Put your gun away, Tom. There is no treasure here." "One man's corn is another pig's treasure."
They leave the cave. The crew is dejected. Piggie tells them to dig deaper in the chests. There is
the real silver and gold in brown bags.

They realize this was his plan all along. He knew that his uncle had covered the treasure. And he suspected the son. He
wanted the crew to have genuine reactions to the corn to make it believable.

## The Popcorn Farmers


----------------------------------------------------------

It was dark and musty in the Dancing Boar Tavern. The light from the fire danced on his red mane casting shaddows like trees on the wall.

"Wait. Did you dye your hair for this story?" Hazel asked. Piggie looked up from the computer. "I did. It's my story and I can tell
it the way I want. Would you like a new color?" "No ... normal old gray is fine."

Hazel sat beside him licking her normal old gray hair.
