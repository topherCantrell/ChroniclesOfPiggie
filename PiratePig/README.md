# Structure

Shooting for 2000 words a night for 25 nights in November. We'll start the material as 25 chapters and combine as needed
in later editing.

# Overview

Piggie and Hazel rent a boat, The Flying Pig, to go after Captain O'Reden's famous treasure. They put together a small crew. Each
crew member gets them through a challenge over the course of the adventure. One crew member is a spy -- son of
an old enemy of O'Reden.

The trip takes two weeks. They sail east from George Town, Grand Cayman to Golden Grove on the east end of Jamaica -- four days. 
Pick apples for a day. Another day 2 days to the tip of Cuba where they face the pirates. Gato Diablo (Hazel drenched in water
and dropped in flower) goes berzerk and saves them. One more day to Tortuga.

Anna Petricole joins the crew and they restock supplies. Anna sees the parrot flying off with notes over the next nights.

Sail north and east towards Bermuda -- out into the deep Atlantic. Four days straight. Piggie guides the ship through the wild
storm.

The next night they face the sea monster. Bones plays the violin to calm it. They lower the dingy filled with rotting, fermented
apples and wine. The monster falls asleep. They sail onward.

- Devil's Maw. Violent currents and shifting tides. Maze of small islands that look like teeth ready to chew a ship ... they see broken ships. Have to go in at two different tide levels. Only this time of year (they are on a tight schedule for this reason). First high-tide to get over a barrier. Then low-tide to get into a tunnel.
- The labyrinth in the caves.
- The chests ... don't open. take back to the ship
- Ship captured by bad guy
- Fight and chase. Heros escape
- Opening the chests
- The Popcorn Farmers
