# Scenes

## The Dancing Boar
Piggie and Hazel at a dark tavern known as The Dancing Boar in a pirate town on the southern coast
of Tortuga. Looking over a dusty map. They have bought a small ship, and they've put out word looking 
for a crew to seek a fabulous treasure -- meeting tonight. 

Six men arrive. Two end up leaving (these are McKracken's son and grandson we find out later). The
older has a colorful parrot that chatters.

The legendary treasure of Captain Red Back burried in a cave in the Carribean. Piggie's
great granddad was cook for Back. Pirate Bill McKracken attacked Back to get the location of the treasure. 
Back gave his map to Piggie's great granddad. The crew was killed and the boat was sunk, but Great escaped
with the map. The map passed to Piggie's granddad, and when he died Piggie got the map. The map
shows the route to the island through the treacherous reefs. And then describes how to find the
treasure.

He unrolls it on the table. Treasure is four chests of silver and gold (ends up being Silver Queen and
Golden Bantam corn) and a small red bag of black pearls (popcorn). The real gold/silver is beneath the
corn. The crew can split the chests. Piggie and Hazel only want the black pearls.

End of the scene is the BAD GUYs leaving. They saw enough of the map to know that the map begins at
Port Royal in Jamaica. They'll attack there and get the map.

## Treasure

The crew find the treasure chests. But the McKrackens hold them at gun point. They open the bag of 
pearls ... popcorn. Try another chest. Break open a bag of silver -- corn. Another chest. The same.
"Put your gun away, Tom. There is no treasure here." "One man's corn is another pig's treasure."
They leave the cave. The crew is dejected. Piggie tells them to dig deaper in the chests. There is
the real silver and gold.
