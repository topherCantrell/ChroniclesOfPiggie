My day started out like any other: I fought the covers and scared Hazel on the way to a good breakfast. You remember the 
routine. But when I was putting my cereal bowl in the dishwasher, there was a knock at the door. That's strange; it's
too early for a deliver.

I hopped down from the counter and looked through the peep hole. There before me were two gigantic black boots with
tucked-in blue pants stretching way up out of sight! Of course, the peep hole I made in the door is only four inches
off the floor, and all boots and legs look big to me.

I opened the door and found a policeman staring down at me. It was officer Riley. I turned and yelled back towards
the kitchen, "Hazel, it's OK. It's just Officer Riley!" That cat is terrified of visitors.

"Good morning, Officer Riley! Come on in! What can I do for you?"

"Hey, Piggie. Good to see you. There is a bit of a mystery developing down at the Home Depo on the Parkway. Frankly, we
are a bit stumped. But this seems right up your alley -- the kind of case you have solved for us before."

Hazel carefully crept around the corner into view. She eased her fat boddy out the door and sniffed cautiously at Officer 
Riley's boots. He regarded her briefly before continuing. "What do you say? Can I talk you into a little detective work?"

"Well, I had big plans today." I tried to pretend like I wasn't interested. I didn't want my excitement to show. "But I guess
I could help you out a little. Let me get my things."

I raced down the hall to the bedroom and dove into the middle drawer of the dresser. Socks and shirts flew in the air as I
rooted around. When the cloth settled I was standing in front of the mirror wearing my faded Deerstalker hat and brown 
overcoat. I carefully tucked my pipe and magnifying glass into the coat pockets and returned down the hall.

"OK, I'm ready. Come on Hazel" I motioned to the door "let's go solve a mystery."

"Hold on there, Sherlock!" Hazel protested, "Not this time! I've had quite enough adventures with you. Remember the last one
I got soaking wet!"

"What, you mean the yard sprinkler? It barely sprayed you." She sat down with her paws crossed in stubborn resolve.
But I had a secret weapon. I reached in my pocket and pulled out a plastic bag of cat treats. "Would you do it for
two Frisky-Snaps?"

Her eyes widened and her nose twitched. She was practically drooling. "Make it three, and you got a deal."

I held out the three fish-shaped crackers and she started out the door "Well come on you two, what are you waiting for?"

Home Depot and 1st South Bank are adjacent. Aaron Wilson works at the Home. Owen Thomas works at the bank. The two
stores are haunted. Night watchmen resign. Mr. Thomas's hair has turned solid white after seeing the ghost.

A few minor items have been taken from the Home: bleach, rope, (other things to make the ghost). The rental tools
are dirtied. Ghost seen on Home camera before cameras are blanked.

Piggie and Hazel spend the night in the Home and see the ghost. are scared off. They come back with a plan. They set
a trap (details of trap) and catch the ghost. Police arrive after Hazel pulls the alarm. The ghost is Mr. Thomas.
Mr. Wilson is digging the tunnel to the bank vault.

Would have gotten away with it too.

What school did you learn that? Elementary, My Dear Watson. My name is Hazel.

Let me get my coat. He comes back with a Sherlock Holmes hat and coat. Later pulls a pipe out of his jacket. You can't
smoke here. Pours in the bubble juice and blows bubbles.
