## The Dancing Boar

One night at the Dancing Boar Tavern. Piggie and Hazel meet up with the crew over dinner. The bad guy is spying on them from another table. 
Piggie shows them the map. They are planning a treasure hunt. The crew keeps all the treasure except for a bag of
Black Pearls that Piggie and Hazel want. The map has mystical clues written on it. One clue is a start date for the
voyage. That date is 10 days away. The bad guy's son is one of the crew (nobody knows he is a spy).

The story opens at the Dancing Boar tavern owned by Piggie and Hazel's family. John McCracken (bad guy) enters the tavern and hides at a 
table to spy on the meeting Piggie is having with the new crew.

We meet the prospective crew. Piggie tells them they are going after Bacher's treasure. They have a map that Piggie's dad took from the 
Captain when Piggie's dad escaped his captors. Piggie shows them all the map. It has mysterious clues written on it. It is only half a map. 
The last clue says they'll find the rest of the map.

Piggie and Hazel want only the bag of "Black Pearls" in the chest. The rest of the treasure will be split evenly among the crew. 

There is a date on the map. Nobody understands why. The journey begins in Tortuga in 10 days. Tortuga is three days sailing from their home port.

After the meeting, we learn that John McCracken's son, Paul, is one of the crew. He'll be sending written updates with his parrot, Booty. We see 
Booty deliver a message in the scene. We learn that John intends to rob Piggie of the treasure -- that he was there the night that Red took the map.

Five days later. Midday at the docks where the Flying Pig is docked. The crew is loading supplies. Piggie is checking off some strange things. The

They approach the coordinates of the first hints on the map: "barrel of flour" and "Diablo Gato". Pirates attack them. Piggie shows Anne the map. Anne tells them the lore of Diablo Gato. A great, white, devil cat that walks the water and eats everyone in her path.

The crew pours cold water over Hazel and drops her in the flour barrel. When the pirates open the door, they are greeted by a growl from the darkness. Hazel is berzerk with anger and leaps out at them. She is ghostly white from the flour. The pirates shout "Diablo Gato" and flee.

Later that evening, Hazel is cleaning herself and has calmed down. Piggie has made her a special apology dish.

## Sea Monster

Four days into the voyage. Late afternoon. Approach the "sea monster" clue on the map. "Violin" and "Dinghy of Apples". Bones plays violin
to calm the beast while they pour the barrel of rum over the apples and feed the dinghy to the giant squid. It fall asleep

Our heroes face the giant squid. They have kept the smelly dinghy of apples on the ship. The map has the clues "violin" and "rum" and "dinghy of apples". Anne has lore -- giant squid that appears on full moon nights.

Piggie commands lowering the sails for the evening. The squid attacks.

Bones stands on the side of the ship and plays the violin. The beast calms and listens. Piggie has an idea. He commands them to pour the two barrels of rum over the apples. Then lowers the putrid boat over the side. Bones continues to play, but the squid is attracted to the smelly apples. It gobbles up the boat of apples.

The squid begins to sway drunkenly with the music. It slides back under the water to sleep off the rum.

Piggie commands half-sail and stays up the night to leave the squid behind.

## Map Font

Hazel is learning to write in the squiggly style of the map clues.

[Draft (not started)](README.md#sea-monster)
<details><summary>Outline</summary>
Hazel and Piggie are sitting in the study looking over the map.

This is where we learn that Hazel loves the squiggly font of the clues on the map. She has been learning to imitate it making little signs and menus that Papa Red hangs up at the tavern. Every day, she makes the "what we have today" sign they hang on the front door. She works on these in the study, and Piggie looks over the map and pushes a wooden top ship along the path. The ship reaches the "monster" clue on the map. He grabs a wooden squid and is playing a battle game "Fire the cannons! BOOM! Full about, Hazel!" etc.

Red comes in to get the menu. He is watching the squid battle. Hazel finished the menu some time ago but is working on something else now. She pulls out the menu and hands it to him. He looks at her current project: "Is that a map of our house?" Red asks her. She is scribbling clues on it in the squiggly font she learned from the treasure map.

She tells Piggie "I made this treasure map for you! There is a special treasure for you at the end!"

Piggie gets all excited and grabs the map "OK! 20 paces out the study door". He counts steps through the door following the map.

Red says to Hazel "It ends up right back here, doesn't it? What's the treasure?" Hazel smiles and pulls out a corn muffin and sets it on a napkin at the end of the table.
