Hazel’s log: day 3. The seas have been calm and the winds steady! Everyone has settled into the routine of life at sea.

I spend the mornings up here in the crow’s nest high above the main sail. I’m journaling our adventures, which haven’t really begun. Maybe I’ll turn it into a book once we are done.

We have a small ship, but so far there hasn’t been any conflict. There was a hint of tension on the first day when Booty thought she belonged up here in the nest instead of me. I settled that at once. Cats over parrots for the win. And yet, I’m still dealing with birds.

Seagulls love it up here, and they fly in from who knows where to sit on the railing around my platform and squawk at me. There is a big white and gray one here now, eyeing the snacks I brought. I’ll have to keep watch on him.

From up here I have a bird — err, cat’s eye view of the whole ship. Booty spends the day perched on the bow of the ship near the crew quarters where she picks up colorful words and phrases from the crew. I wish she’d spend less time listening to Rock and his “wisdom”.

Rock and Paul do most of the physical labor aboard the ship. That usually involves tightening sail ropes and raising and lowering parts of the sails with the change in winds.

At this moment, the two are huddled at the back of the boat. Rock teaches Paul how to tie a super-secret sailor’s knot he learned over the years. As usual, Rock sprinkles in many of his spicy sentence enhancers that aren’t really needed for the task. But I must admit: the knots do seem stronger when tied in authentic sailor gibberish.

Between knots, Paul points questioningly to a tattoo on Rock’s bulging, muscular arm. Rock laughs and relives the story of that particular day. I only get words and fragments of the story from way up here, but I can piece together the gist of it. Some girl at some port with a broken heart because his true love was the sea.   

Bones McGhee is sitting on the deck directly below me. He’s mending an old backup sail with a steel needle and thick black string. I’ve watched those long, bony fingers in action, counting money or pressing buttons on his cash register at his store in town. They seem nimble and well-suited for the task at hand.

Bones pauses, pulls a green apple from his pocket, and takes a bite. Breakfast and lunch on the ship is usually light — usually leftovers from the dinner the night before. But oh wow, what meals Piggie cooks up for us!

After those nightly feasts, the crew crawls up the stairs to the main deck, flops against the ropes, barrels, and riggings, and groans contentedly.  Bones serenades them with songs from his violin. First, with chirpy, happy songs. Then, with soft, slow melodies to lull them to sleep.

At some point in the night, we all manage to find our beds. Paul, Bones, and Rock have bunks in the forecastle at the front of the boat. Piggie and I share the Captain’s quarters, which have been turned into a planning room for the whole crew. Piggie and I don’t occupy much space, and we swapped the bed for a big table. 

Piggie sleeps in his open sea chest, curled up in a blanket. I sleep on a pillow at the top of our cupboard. But some nights Piggie gets to snoring like ?insert metaphor?. On those nights, I grab a pillow and move to my crow’s nest. If the weather is too bad, I'll gently close the sea chest! Note to self: oil the hinges.

TODO rooting in the covers. After the long ritual, Piggie ends up where he started.

He gets still and quiet. Then his back left leg twitches a little. Then suddenly more rooting. Grunt before next flurry of activity. Ends with a long sigh.

Show this ritual first from the eyes of Hazel. Then later, another instance of the ritual from Piggie's point of view.

I wake up every morning to Piggie’s voice, merrily barking orders from behind the ship’s wheel. “Raise that ?sailing term?, Paul. That’s it, mate! Rock, pull that ?sailing term? You got it now. I’ve never seen such a fine crew in all my years!”

He looks right at home there, standing on the barrel we placed so he could reach the top of the large steering wheel. His black mane blows out behind his hat in the wind — the twinkle in his eye as he adjusts the wheel for some approaching wave. I’m trying to sketch him like that on the first page of my journal. That would be the perfect cover for my book.

I take a moment to read back over my journal. It’s in ink, so I can’t correct anything. Instead, I like to add little swirly vines and leaves to some of the letters — usually the big capital letters at the start of a sentence. Some of my decorated words look like they were grown in a jungle!

I hear Bones below me, crunching on his apple again. I guess it is time for my mid-morning snack. Hey! Wait a minute! I brought three hush puppies up here with me this morning. There’s only one left!

But now, there are two of those seagulls sitting on the railing above me, eyeing the one remaining. They think they are cute and sneaky, but I wrote the book on cute and sneaky. I’ll just push this last one a little closer to them. Come and get it, fellas! Looks like I’m having seagull for lunch!
