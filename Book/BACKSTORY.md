Papa Red (Mason) is human. Piggie is a stuffed pig. Hazel is a cat. Nibbles is a mouse. All other characters are human. Well, Booty is a parrot, but just a regular parrot.

Mason and Violet grew up in the seaport town of Craymoor. Mason's parents were farmers. Violet's parents had passed away. Violet lived with her grandmom in a house attached 
to the restaurant. The harbor town is named Craymoor. Mason is bright red headed. Nickname Red. Piggie and Hazel call him Papa Red.

Red spent most of his free time at the restaurant. Partly because he liked cooking. Mostly because he liked Violet, who worked in the restaurant 
with her grandmom. 

Red and Violet married young at 20. Red's parents were farmers. Red moved into the house with Violet and her grandmom, who passed away 
three years later. Red works at the restaurant with Violet. Red turns into quite a good cook.

Sailors dined at the restaurant. Talked of exotic spices and dishes. Took Red with them on a two-month run here and there. Red came back with 
dishes and spices and exciting stories. Red learned ships and the sea. The restaurant flourished. Red is 25 no children. Red's parents pass 
away leaving him them the farm. It remains unused.

Age 30. Piggie and Hazel join the family. Grow up around the docks. Red goes on occasional trips, but doesn't take the kids. Echo's the mom's 
wish that they stay safe from the sea.

Age 40. Red is kidnapped by Bacher to be his chef. He promises Violet and kids he'll be back. Escapes the captain during a mutiny and returns 
home after 2 months. He has a treasure map. Shows the family. Hazel loves the swirly writing and learns to letter that way.

Red tells the story of the escape with just the map and a small box of salt. Shows them the salt. Washes up on an island for a week when 
Bacher's body washes up. He gets the key. Builds a fire and is rescued. Why take the salt? Very exotic tasty, aged salt.

Red has changed. Takes the kids with him on all his voyages. Piggie and Hazel learns the ways of the sea. Hazel likes writing and drawing up 
in the crow's nest. Hazel is dextrous and good with jumping between the sails and pulling the ropes.

Red buys a ship. Says he and the kids are going for the treasure. Violet: only half a map? You'll get that treasure when pigs fly! Names the 
ship The Flying Pig. There is a firm date on the map about when the treasure hunt should begin. They are getting ready. Red wants the black pearls. The rest 
of the treasure means nothing to him.

Red aged 50 (makes John McCracken 45). The time for the trip is a month away. Red sends Piggie and Hazel without him. He knows from the past
that he isn't on the voyage. They should bring back the pearls. He wants Piggie and Hazel to go without  him -- he knows they will find the 
rest of the map -- he has seen it, but can't explain.

Our story begins a week before the voyage in the Dancing Boar.
