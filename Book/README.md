Once upon a time in the Caribbean, circa 1700, Piggie and Hazel set out to find Captain Bacher's legendary treasure. 
With a mysterious pirate map in hand, they struggle through many challenges. Their adventure even leads them through a time 
portal to the past and future. In the end, they find the treasure and live happily ever after.

# The Dancing Boar

Piggie and Hazel meet up with the crew at the Dancing Boar Tavern. The bad guy is spying on them from another table. 
Piggie shows them the map. They are planning a treasure hunt. The crew keeps all the treasure except for a bag of
Black Pearls that Piggie and Hazel want. The map has mystical clues written on it. One clue is a start date for the
voyage. That date is 10 days away. The bad guy's son is one of the crew (nobody knows he is a spy).
