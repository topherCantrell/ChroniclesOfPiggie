## The Dancing Boar

One night at the Dancing Boar Tavern. Piggie and Hazel meet up with the crew over dinner. The bad guy is spying on them from another table. 
Piggie shows them the map. They are planning a treasure hunt. The crew keeps all the treasure except for a bag of
Black Pearls that Piggie and Hazel want. The map has mystical clues written on it. One clue is a start date for the
voyage. That date is 10 days away. The bad guy's son is one of the crew (nobody knows he is a spy).

The story opens at the Dancing Boar tavern owned by Piggie and Hazel's family. John McCracken (bad guy) enters the tavern and hides at a 
table to spy on the meeting Piggie is having with the new crew.

We meet the prospective crew. Piggie tells them they are going after Bacher's treasure. They have a map that Piggie's dad took from the 
Captain when Piggie's dad escaped his captors. Piggie shows them all the map. It has mysterious clues written on it. It is only half a map. 
The last clue says they'll find the rest of the map.

Piggie and Hazel want only the bag of "Black Pearls" in the chest. The rest of the treasure will be split evenly among the crew. 

There is a date on the map. Nobody understands why. The journey begins in Tortuga in 10 days. Tortuga is three days sailing from their home port.

After the meeting, we learn that John McCracken's son, Paul, is one of the crew. He'll be sending written updates with his parrot, Booty. We see 
Booty deliver a message in the scene. We learn that John intends to rob Piggie of the treasure -- that he was there the night that Red took the map.
