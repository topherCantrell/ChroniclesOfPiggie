# Captain (Kernel) Orville Bacher's Treasure

Captain Bacher is a minor, flat character. He is the epitome of a ruthless pirate. He amasses quite a treasure over his long career, but he spends much of it in the ports and towns. His crew gets far less than their fair shares. He keeps the best pieces of plunder -- gold and silver coins -- for himself. 

Captain Bacher loves to eat. He grows fat in his old age. He has a special love for corn. His crew calls him "Kernel" because he never leaves a kernel of corn on his plate or on the cob. He eats every kernel. He dines at the taverns in every port along his journeys, looking for the best corn dishes. He sails to far-away towns off the pirate hunting grounds chasing the rumors of exotic corn. 

In his old age, his quest for fine food leads him into our story when he visits the Dancing Boar tavern owned by Piggie's dad.

Bacher keeps his treasure in a large, five-foot sea chest in his cabin. There are two of these chests: one for his clothes and personal effects and one for the treasure. A single, intricate key opens both chests. The key never leaves the chain around his neck.

The tale of Bacher's treasure is well known. When Bacher is full of food and spirits, he boasts to the tavern patrons about it. After 20 years of plundering, his treasure chest fills up. He finds a remote island to bury the chest, and he makes a detailed map with clues that he understands.

The crew helps him hide the chest, but he doesn't trust them. He kills them all and leaves the bodies on the island to guard the treasure. Dead men tell no tales, and they steal no treasure. He sails the ship all by himself back to Tortuga and hires a new crew. He keeps the map locked away in the chest in his cabin.

The years pass. Bacher becomes more obsessed with food and less with piracy. He becomes old and fat and stingy with the crew. The crew becomes disgruntled.

One night, the pirate ship sails into Piggie's hometown, where Red and Violet run the pub. Bacher and crew eat at the pub. Red serves up an unusually good corn dish. Bacher kidnaps Red and forces him to be his cook. There is a fight, but Red agrees to join them if the pirates leave Violet, Hazel, and Piggie in peace. See the chapter: Kidnapped.

Back on the open seas a week later, the disgruntled crew plans a mutiny. They plan to kill Bacher and take the treasure in his cabin along with the map to the hidden treasure.

"There are diamonds. There is gold and silver covered in Gold and Silver. And a small bag of the Black Pearls."

The diamonds, gold, and silver are hidden beneath the false bottom of the chest. When they open the chest, they find bags of Silver Queen white corn and Golden Silk yellow corn. The Black Pearls are a bag of popcorn seeds. This is a special breed of corn from the Far East, the likes of which are never seen in our world today.

This false treasure tricks John in the end when he tries to rob them of the recovered treasure. Only Piggie and Hazel know the real treasure is under the false bottom. John laughs and leaves them with their precious corn.

When John is gone, the crew splits the real treasure. Piggie and Hazel want only the Black Pearl popcorn. There is enough to pop that evening. The rest they take back to Red to start a popcorn farm. They make a lot of money with the special popcorn.
