The Dancing Boar

It was dark and musty in the Dancing Boar Tavern. The light from the fire danced on his red mane, casting shadows like trees on the wall.  "Wait. Did you dye your hair for this story?" Hazel asked. Piggie looked up from the computer. "I did. It's my story, and I can tell it the way I want. Would you like a new color?" "No ... normal old gray is fine."  Hazel sat beside him, licking her normal old gray hair. 

McCracken enters the pub

John McKraken is McCracken is supposed to have a peg leg. I need to work that in at the beginning. That's why he doesn't just steal the map and go after it himself ... let Piggie do the work.

A man in all black stood outside the entrance to the Dancing Boar tavern. He was a tall, hulking man, but he cowered into his coat and pulled his hat down to look as small and inconspicuous as possible. He glanced up at the tavern sign and frowned. On the sign above, a plump pig danced gaily. This place was many things to many people but rarely was there happy dancing. He shifted his gaze left and right without moving his head — checking to see if anyone was watching. Then he ducked into the tavern.

He paused momentarily by the large bar, waiting for his vision to adjust to the dark. An old, haggard bar wench pushed past him, grabbed four mugs of drinks from the bar, and sloshed back into the mist of the room. A six-foot fireplace roared in the back wall of the tavern. The man in black pushed into the room and weaved towards the back.

Bright oil lamps hanging from the ceiling lit a large table near the middle of the room. Six young adults drank, ate, and laughed as he passed. Beyond that, a man and woman huddled together at a small round table. They whispered and flirted with each other in the dim candlelight.	And beyond that, on the fringes of the room, shady customers sat in complete darkness, silence. What foul deeds and deals were being discussed at those tables, he wondered. That was definitely the section where he belonged.

He chose a small table against a wall close enough to see the fireplace but not close enough for it to expose him. He sat down and adjusted his chair for a clear view of the fireplace. Not the fireplace, but the long table in front of it. 

The bar wench approached and set a lit candle in front of him. “What’ll it be?” She asked. For a second, his black-bearded face was visible. He wore a jagged scar above his left eye. He wore a black eye patch over his right eye. He ducked from view beneath his hat. A black gloved hand darted from his coat and pinched the flame out with a quick sizzle.

"Ale," he barked. And he stared again -- not at the fireplace or the long table or even the pitiful band of pirates sitting around it. His gaze fixed on the brown and tattered treasure map rolled up against a stack of their empty dinner plates.

Introductions

I want to re-work this so the reader meets the monstrous shadow of Piggie first -- daunting and frightening. Then, work into his real physical description.

He would tell you: my body is a long, brown, furry tube with a gray face on one end and a white "wash with care" tag at the other for my tail. I have a white and black snout with just a hint of pink. I am a full eight-and-a-half inches long if I stretch way out, but on all fours, I am barely half that tall. I have black and brown button eyes. I have four dark brown legs, each capped with black feet/hands; I have no toes or fingers, so they are the same thing for me. I have a pure black patch of hair on top of my head. That's my mane. My granddad was pure Razor-Back.

"Brandy, fetch another round!" Captain Piggie sat at the head of the table near the fireplace. He lifted his wooden tankard with both hands and drained its remaining contents mostly into his mouth, but a stream of grape Koolaid spilled around the corners of his mouth, down his chin, and onto his already-stained shirt. With a belch and a sigh, he slammed the mug back onto the table with all the might his little two-inch arms could muster.

The flickering flames in the fireplace behind Captain Piggie cast his six-foot shadow across the far wall. The roaring fire flickered behind him, and the hairs of Piggie's shadow mane danced on the wall like monstrous black snakes. As the flames waved, so did his shadow's spiked mane.	

"Thank you all for coming. Most of you know each other, but young Paul here just joined the crew. His dad, John McKraken, isMcCracken, isMcCracken, is funding our journey for one share of the treasure. John insisted we take Paul with us to look after his interests. We'll need a fresh pair of young legs on this adventure -- none of us are getting any younger, eh? Paul, this is Hazel, my sister and first mate. Her mom -- our mom -- rescued me as a newborn orphan piglet and raised me as one of her own. But that's a tale for another time."

Work in Hazel's description: long-haired gray dilute calico with green eyes and a furry white tummy I don't recommend trying to rub unless you are wearing armor gloves.

Hazel held out her paw with razor-sharp claws fully extended. She smiled and retracted the claws and reached to shake Paul's hand.

"Welcome aboard," she said.

"And this," Piggie gestured to the tall thin man on his left, "is Bill McGee. Everyone just calls him "Bones" because, well, he's tall and thin and kind of bony.

Bones held out a pasty white hand with long, bony fingers. He nodded at Paul and tipped his long, thin nose down as a greeting. Small black eyes, thin black hair. You get the idea. Basically, Mr. Burns from the Simpsons. He's the shop owner giving and is giving us a nice discount on supplies in return for his share of the treasure.

"The muscular mountain sitting next to you is Chip Mullins. We just call him Rock because, well, that's sort of what he is. He works on the docks moving heavy cargo on and off the ships as they come and go. He's as strong as four regular men but only costs us one share of treasure!"

Rock reached out a massive hand that swallowed Paul's own. He smiled and gave the hand a not-so-gentle squeeze, and said, "Nice to meet you." Paul smiled back and rubbed his aching hand secretly under the table.

The treasure map

Maggie clears the dinner plates from the table and Piggie carefully unrolls the map before them.

"This is it, maties. This is the map I told you about. This is Captain Bacher's fabled treasure map. Captain Bacher was a ruthless pirate. Rumor was he hid his treasure on a remote island before he died." [We'll tease out this story a little over the next few chapters before traveling through time and living it.]

"You mean before his crew killed him!" Rock slammed a fist on the table.

"Yes, that's how the story goes. Treasure hunters have been looking for his legendary riches for 50 years. Nobody found the treasure ... many never found their way home. The treasure, legend says, is protected by traps and curses"

"And the ghosts of all them treasure hunters!" Rock again.

"So the story goes." Piggie  continued, "But this here is the one and only map he ever made to remind him how to get past those traps to his treasure!."

"How did you come by this," Paul asked.

"Well, now," Piggie leaned back in his chair, "Captain Bacher and his crew rolled into port in Juarez, where my Pappa Red ran a restaurant. They liked his food so much that they enlisted him (enslaved, really) for the remainder of that last fateful voyage. A week later, Pappa Red swims ashore in Cuba with this map, a broken wooden spoon, and this".

Piggie looks around, leans into the table, and slowly pulls a silver necklace from his shirt. At the end of the necklace is a small, intricately carved silver key.

"Only the one who has this key can open the treasure!"

"So the story goes," Paul says sarcastically.

Piggie tucked the key back into his shirt collar.

The deal

"And here is my offer -- mine and Hazel's. You will be the finest crew ever to sail the seas. Follow my orders, and we'll find Bacher's treasure. You all know the story: it's said to be a single oversized chest filled to the top with silver and gold. And at the very top of that pile of loot is one small bag of black pearls ... the richest, darkest pearls ever seen. That bag of pearls is all I want -- all Hazel and I want. The rest of the treasure is all yours to divide in equal shares. Oh, and minus the share we give to Paul's dad in payment for our ship. Now. What do you say?"

"That's really all you want?" Paul asked, "Just a bag of pearls? And we divide up all that gold and silver? And your first mate is good with that?"

Hazel nodded.

"So what say you? Whose in?"

There was a tense moment of silence as everyone looked at his neighbor. Bones, a man of few words all night, was first to speak.

"As this story goes ... I'm in," he placed his right palm on the table.

One by one, the other hands joined his on the table. Paul's hand was the last.

I need to work in the man in black smiling a wicked smile and putting his hand silently on his own table.

How do I feel about this chapter? There are lots of "to be done" notes throughout, and I refuse to read back over it now for fear of giving up in disgust. I don't want to will be more of that in chapters to come. And of course we relive the past in the time travel event. I need to work on the dialog and the "he said, she said" and descriptive narrative sprinkled in with the dialog. The map is just HALF OF A MAP. That needs to fleshed out here along with the notes and the last note "get 2nd half of map". 

"Only with the spring tides." Either leave now or wait till next year.
