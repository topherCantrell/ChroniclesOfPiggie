# Outline

This story is a treasure hunt. Piggie and Hazel set out to find Captain Bacher's hidden treasure.

## The treasure hunters

The story begins at the Dancing Boar, a restaurant/pub in a harbor town in the Caribbean circa 1700.
We follow a shady man into the pub one night. He's all in black with an oversized coat and hat. He 
wears an eye patch. He limps on his peg-leg. This is the bad guy, John McKracken who seeks the 
treasure too.

Piggie and Hazel are sitting at a large table. The man sits out of sight but within hearing range.

We meet the rest of the crew as they join Piggie and Hazel. We meet Chip "Rock" Mullins, a stout
man who works the docks (picture a short Dave Bautista). He is the muscle for the crew. Paul McKracken 
is with him. He's a young redhedded kid. Paul joined Rock on the docks a few months back. He is still 
green, but eager. 

Next joins Billy "Bones" McGee. He is older and skinny with a pointed nose and bony fingers (thus the 
nickname). Picture Montgomery Burns from the Simpson. Bones runs the harbor supply store, and will
furnish much of the food and gear they need for the two month adventure (round trip).

## Captain Bacher

Captain Bacher's story is well known. He was the terror of the seas and accumulated a small fortue.
He kept most of the treasure for himself and shared a small part with the crew, who became
increasingly disgruntal. The legend goes that he and his first mate slipped off to an island and
burried a large chest filled with gold and silver. On the way back, Bacher killed his first mate to
keep the location secret. He made a map to the treasure he kept locked away in another huge chest
in his cabin on the ship. He wore the key around his neck.

The ship came to Piggie's home town when Piggie and Hazel were 10ish. Bacher was tired of the cooking
on his ship and kidnapped Red to cook for them. Piggie's father, Papa Red, was on the ship a week
later when the crew mutinied. Bacher died in the fire and the ship sank. But Red escaped with the
treasure map and key and a wooden spoon.

There is time-travel in this story. The mutiny and fire 20 years ago are an important scene because 
Piggie and Hazel step through the time portal to that night and help their father. More on this later.

Back at the Dancing Boar. Piggie unrolls the map and shows them. When Red returned from his kidnapping,
he taught Piggie and Hazel the ways of the sea. Piggie and Hazel grew up studying the map and the clues.
It was Red's plan for them one day to seek the treasure together. But Red is sick now. He is expected to 
recover, but in no shape to sail. And sail they must why? Because there is a date written at the starting
point of the map. That date is in two weeks. The map tells them they have to set sail from Tortuga on that
day.

The right 1/4th of the map is torn off. The map shows their path from the port city (pirate city) of Torguga. 
That is where they begin, but the path takes them off the ragged edge of the map to where the torn section 
would be. There are swirly writings on the map -- clues and headings. The last clue along the path is "rest 
of the map". Piggie believes this is where they will find the rest of the map.

To finish up character introductions, they pick up Anna Baptiste in Tortuga. She is a black
Hatian mystic, filled with magic and voodoo. She has dreadlocks and a thick Hatian accent (picture the 
character Tia Dalma in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies). They rescue her in Torguga. Her wisdom 
and near-magic will prove valuable on the adventure.

# The treasure

All know the legend of the treasure. A giant chest filled with silver and gold. Bacher kept Red chained in
the captain's cabin, and he drank and talked about the treasure. He told red the details of the contents
of the chest. Gold and silver beneath gold and silver. And on top of that, a small bag.

(As the story progresses, we learn of Bacher's love for popcorn). We learn later that the bag has his
prized treasure: the finest black pearls. At the end of the story, the treasure chest is filled with
bags of yellow "Golden Ear" and white "Silver Queen" corn kernels. The plack pearls are an extinct
type of popcorn -- "Black Pearls". Black hulls, but the best tasting golden pops. This fools the
bad guy at the end and he leaves them with the chest. The chest is huge. There is a false bottom they
open with the key. It is filled with true gold and silver coins and diamonds.

Back at the pub. The deal Piggie offers is for the crew to split all the gold and silver in the chest 
equally. Piggie and Hazel want only the small bag.

The end of the story finds Piggie, Hazel, and Nibbles back home. They are popcorn farmers. Papa Red is out 
in the fields weeding the crop of Black Pearl corn they are growing. Violet is tending the pub as a hobby. 
The popcorn they sell in the supply store brings in all the money they could ever want.

The book closes with a time travel scene. They are expecting Hazel from the past. They give her the map
all annotated (Hazel has been doing the notes). Nibbles gives her the cheese she must give him in the past 
(another part of the adventure).
