This is a flashback scene we see just before the storm. In the storm chapter, Piggie and Hazel are masters of sailing working together. But it wasn't always so. This flashback is their first attempt.

Pappa Red has them out in the ocean on the ship on a calm day. Hazel is up in the rigging ready to do the "heights" work and rope management. Piggie has a crate pulled up to the wheel ready to steer.

Pappa Red begins instructions, but Piggie is all "I know how to do it!". He's been watching Red.

The goal is to turn the ship around and sail back to port.

Piggie starts calling out random commands he has heard Red use. He messes up technical words and says "whatchamacallit" and "the thingie" a time or two. Hazel is up in the rigging trying to pull the right ropes, but she fumbles and stumbles.

The ship does circles and figure 8s. Maybe we get this view from a seagull high above watching. Piggie is fighting the wheel -- it fights back. He overcorrects and the ship veers back and forth.

Hazel is jumping from mast to mast and misses. She lands on the main sail with her claws dug in. She slides down the sail ripping it in half. The mast flops around above Pigge. The ripped sail nearly takes him out.

He panics and yells "Hazel! Abandon ship! Everyone abandon ship!" Hazel runs into the hold closing the door behind her. Piggie dives into a pile of ropes and squirms his head in. His back side is sticking out with legs kicking.

Papa Red laughs and laughs and says "We clearly have some work to do!"

The next scene is back after the flashback -- the storm. Piggie is expertly giving commands and steering. Hazel is like a gymnist jumping from mast to mast.

## The Island

<details><summary>Outline</summary>

Devil's Maw. Violent currents and shifting tides. Maze of small islands that look like teeth ready to chew a ship ... they see broken ships. Have to go in at two different tide levels. Only this time of year (they are on a tight schedule for this reason). First high-tide to get over a barrier. Then low-tide to get into a tunnel. - The labyrinth in the caves. - The chests ... don't open. take back to the ship - Ship captured by bad guy - 

The Gizzard  Also known as The Grinder. A 5 square mile oval patch of hundreds of mini islands, some 50 feet high. Sheer cliffs and gnarly passages. No beaches. High waves and currents and winds. Some islands just below the surface. Called The Grinder because it chews up any ships that try to enter. Only a small ship can navigate the passages. But what fool would brave the waves in a small boat?  The map leads them to the entry point island (specific shape). Then to the next and so on to the treasure. You have to go in at high tide to avoid the submersed rocks. Once you are at the destination, you have to wait for low tide to reveal the cave. The cave passage leads up inside the island above sea-level where the threasure chest is hidden. Then wait for high tide and take the passage out. Have to take a row boat on the last island hop.  Our heros are nearing the destination and spot the McKracken ship in the distance as they board the row boat. They leave one sailor behind to watch the ship. It is the McKracken son. They are watching ... waiting for the heros to  bring the treasure out and then steal it from them. Piggie has an idea (we don't discover it). Piggie says they don't know how to get in, and they can outrun them once they are out. McKracken son sends the map via the parrot. Or maybe a copy of the map. The reader catches him making the copy earlier.  The heros find the chest, but Piggie doesn't want them to open it until they are back on the ship. He insists they don't open it (part of the plan). They find an opening onto the island that lets them get back to the ship while the tide is up. When they get back to the ship, they find the McKrackens with guns drawn. They haul the crew and the chest on board.

## Opening the Chest

One Man's Trash  They open the chest and open the black bag. It is popcorn. Then they open the next bag of "silver" ... silver queen corn. And a gold one ... more corn. McKracken laughs ... tells the crew that they have been suckerd ... that piggie knew all along this was the treasure. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Piggie is all excited by the corn.  They open the bag of  pearls ... popcorn. Try another chest. Break open a bag of silver -- corn. Another chest. The same. "Put your gun away, Tom. There is no treasure here." "One man's corn is another pig's treasure." They leave the cave. The crew is dejected. Piggie tells them to dig deaper in the chests. There is the real silver and gold in brown bags.  They realize this was his plan all along. He knew that his uncle had covered the treasure. And he suspected the son. He wanted the crew to have genuine reactions to the corn to make it believable.

The last scene of the book is Piggie and Hazel relaxing in their home. Hazel is working on the map. Piggie goes back to the kitchen to check on something very important he is cooking.

Hazel says she is almost done, and he says to wait for him before finishing the last stroke. He wants to be there.

He comes walking in carying a plate of corn fritters and says. Is this how you remember it? Pretty mnuch ... no wait, you were wearing your captain's hat. Piggie takes it down and puts it on "Ready!" she smiles knowingly and finishes the last word with a swirl. The portal appears and hazel steps out. Hazel rolls up the map and says "here you go, past me!"

Hazel takes the map and turns to leave. Piggie: "Wait ... " He passes the plate to his hazel and she takes one. He turns to the past hazel, and she takes one.

Future hazel: toasts with a fritter -- to the past!

Past hazel: uh ... to the future!

Piggie:smiling at the corn fritter -- To the treasure!

hazel bites the fritter and steps back into the portal.

Remember Nibbles here. He gives Hazel the cheese.
