## Cave of Time

<details><summary>Outline</summary>

Anna wakes early. Uneasy feeling about the upcoming day.

Watching Piggie on deck. Piggie working his magic. Sextant and timer. Spotting a bright morning star. Soft glow of sunrise beginning. Looking at map. Other things. Some mysterious sea navigation voodoo ... licks the end of a long stick and waves it in the air then sniffs it frowning and nodding. Making notes in his journal about the results.

Crew begins to man the decks. Breakfast is leftovers and fruit. Busy day.

Anne tries to talk them out of it. The Crell were a mysterious race. And dangerous. Time travel is not to be taken lightly. Might mess up the whole universe. There were two gods of time ... past and future. Legend says the river of time flows between them with the island (the present) in the middle of the stream.

Foggy. Breaks and they see the island.

The base of the island is a large cone rising from the water. A hundred feet up, it flattens and splits into two sharp cones rising another hundred feet. One cone carved statue head of the god of the past ?name? and one with the head of the god of the future ?name?. The heads are facing each other.

The edges of the island are steep cliffs all the way around.  No way to land on the island or climb the cones.

Carved heads of the ?name? all around the cliffs on pedestals or purtruding or in releif. Square eyes rotated at different degrees always parallel to the sea. Triangle noses always closer to one eye or the other. No pattern. heads are tall and rectangular but sharply bent to the side, front, or back just above the eyes. No pattern.

Piggie instructs to sail around the island clockwise around to the left. Anne gives them lore of the ?name? always talking in dark, sinister descriptions. The time-people are to be feared and avoided. The heros should not be here.

Part way around they find a cave at the water line leading into darkness. The tunnel is big enough to fit the ship and its tall masts, but there is a strong current flowing out. They try to sail up to get a closer view, but the water pushes them away. They sail on around.

They judge their position by the position of the heads high above. When they get to opposite of the island, they find another cave same size and shape as the first. But the strong current is flowing into this cave.

Piggie barks orders and fights the wheel to keep the ship out of the current. They sail away from the island, lower sails, and hold their distance.

What do you think? Anna thinks they should sail away as fast as possible. Rock suggests that the current flows clean through the island to the otherside and that the map must be in the middle. Bones cautions that it would take days with ropes and pulleys to back the ship out if they get stuck. WIsh they had the dinghy to explore.

Piggie asks Hazel what she things. The map hasn't led them wrong so far. No mention of danger. Piggie says to be ready on the ropes in case there is a dock. Raise the front sail a bit to move into the stream.

They sail around to the back side. Another cave (mouth, giant head) with current flowing in. The other god of time. Suspect the stream flows through and can carry them out the other side. They can't fight the current. They are pulled in ... no choice.

The Chronosians are a mysterious culture that Anna fears.

They worship the gods of time: Ruuta (like “rooting” around in the cabinet for popcorn) is the god of things to come: the future.

Paiste (like “toothpaste”) is the god of things that have already been: the past.

Time is the present and flows from god to the other.

Chronosians carved giant heads (like Easter Island). The heads are blocky and bent at angles from the eyes up. No particular pattern in which direction or what degree they are bent. Some are pointed, others blocky, most tapered at the top — somewhere between the extremes.

Little is known about the Kronosians and their island Kronosia. It was destroyed in a volcano eruption 400 years ago and most of the buildings and temples were lost. Pieced together their history. They seemed to have begun appruptly 700 years before. Tools and art just appeared with no evolution. In fact, they seem to have devolved slightly until the volcano.

One theory is that when the volcano erupted, the whole civilization moved back in time 700 years, when the civilization started. They live in a loop with no beginning or ending. Unnatural, mysterious. Anna really fears it.

Their main religious temple  is built backwards.

The upper part with its decore and balsat rocks dates to the oldest, earliest years of their civilization. But the base is built with their modern art and style — from lava rocks formed after the volcano eruption. 

The rocks in the base are younger than the rocks in the top.

The theory is that they took the rocks back in time and built the foundation and the rest of the temple was built from the current rocks.

Nobody knows                            

The cave is dark. They light torches and float into the cave. River twists out of sight of the entrance. River widens out to a large cavern. Current isn't as strong at the widening, but still flowing. Rock piers along both sides of the cavern with rock tie points. Piggie orders tieing a line to the back of the boat. Rock jumps overboard with the other end and swims to the landing. Ties rope to a rock tie point. Current pulls the boat to the pier.

Oil torches all around mounted to the wall. Crew begins to light them.

Piggie and Bones stood at the front of the boat. Bones held the torch high and just behind them to keep the bright fire from flashing their eyes.

Piggie and Bones stood at the front of the boat — first to enter the cave’s dark shadow. Bones held the torch as high as he could. Piggie shielded his eyes from the bright fire above and strained his eyes to adjust to the dark.

Piggie watched the smooth, round tunnel walls slip slowly by. The size and shape of the tunnel never changed, but the passage turned slightly to the left so gradually you wouldn’t notice it. Soon the mouth of the cave was hidden around the bend and they floated silently in utter darkness.

The ship had drifted close to the wall. Piggie held his hand against the wall letting the moist, cool rock slide by under his touch. A sudden indention and he lurched into the darkness nearly losing his balance. It was a giant head carved into relief in the wall. Like the other statues they had seen, the head was abnormally tall and slanted sharply to the right from the ears up.

“Mora!” Anne whispered from the deck behind them. Her voice amplified and echoed by the rock tunnel.

The echoes died and the silence returned. They drifted along quietly for what seemed like an eternity but was only a couple of minutes.

Piggie moves to the front. The wheel isn't going to help riding a current. Bones lights a torch and joins him. He holds the torch high, and Piggie puts his hands over his eyes to keep the bright fire from washing out his vision as his eyes adjust.

The tunnel ever so slowly bends  to the left. Once the mouth of the cave is out of sight, they are in pictch black with a cold, damp draft and burble of the current along the wall. The ship bumps against the wall. Piggie: everyone hold on.

Piggie lets the cool, damp wall slide by under his fingers. Then the wall vanishes and he lurches forward almost falling out. It is the indention of a ?name? head in relief. There is another facing this one on the opposite wall. The smooth wall returns.

After two minutes, which feels like hours in the creepy void, they see a dim light ahead. Have they sailed through? Did they miss something? Maybe the faces?

But the tunnel opens to a large cavern. The current slows a bit having widened out, but still moving along at a walk.

There are white glowing gems all over the ceiling. They can see two docks on the left and right jutting out into the cave lake. No way to get to them ... just carried along by the current. There is a round rock pole sticking out of the water directly in front of them with a glowing gem topping it into a point.

Piggie things fast. Rock, get one of the large ropes and loop it around that pole. And hurry before we pass it. Rock hustled in the familiar sea-hand task. Ropes ... loops ... knots ... this all second nature to him. He heaves the loop over the pole as it passes the back of the boat, where he's standing and pulls it hard to tighten it.

Got it! Good now bring the other end and wrap it around the forward mast a couple of times.

The rope began to uncoil slowly as the ship drifted towards the center of the room. Rock and Paul hauled the large coil of rope to the front of the ship, gave it a little slack, and wrapped it around the front mast near where Piggie was standing.

The drifting ship pulled the rope tight, but rock held the rope tight, and the wraps held the ship in place. Everyone watch the rope now. Don't get pulled overboard! 

The rope creaked with tension. Slowly the back of the boat, carried by the current, slid around until the ship was facing the way it came into the current held in place by the rope and the peer.

Well done lad! Now ease the rope out and let's back into the room!

Rock eased his grip and the rope slid around the mast. The ship backed slowly into the enter of the cavern.

Anna joins Rock at the back of the boat (now the front of their travel) and describes what she sees.

Two docks left and right. Faces of the gods carved into the wall, and their mouthes open, facing each other. A fast moving river flowing from the right mouth, through an arch in the dock and into the lake. The left face was identical except the river flowed into it just as quickly.. And farther on at the cave's back wall, they could see a tunnel leading out the same size as the one they came in on.

Like a giant tongue, a rock peer extends out into the water. They dock and light more torches on the pier.

The statue heads are all wavy/bent/warped. The main temple of time entrance is the eyes are bent over one on top of the other.

There was light from around the turn in front of them. The tunnel began to widen. They floated into a large cavern. Strange glowing crystals littered the walls and smooth ceiling lighting the entire room in a dim glow.

The current slowed in the larger room. They crawled toward the middle of the room. A line of rock columns appeared in the water beside them. Each perfect cylinder rose ten feet with a shaped crystal point on top. They lined a path to the middle of the room. The ship passed them nervously — missing them by barely 10 feet.

Ahead, Piggie could see a long rock island in the middle of the room. The current would carry them close to the dock. Piggie had an idea.

“Rock!” He called. “Cut the anchor loose from its rope. Tie a big loop in the free end and toss it over one of those columns.”

Rock scrambled behind them. Paul cut the three inch thick anchor rope ?check the diameters of anchor roped? Just above the knot tied in the eye of the iron anchor. Rock pulled slack and tied a four foot lasso slip knot — everyday kind of stuff for him. Paul helped him haul the heavy loop to the edge of the boat. With a grunt, Rock tossed the loop over the pole.

?Anchor rope attached to ship? Adjustable? Let it out?

The main river flows through the cave. The room is a "+" shape. The main river flows through. A smaller river flows left to right ... out of the mouth of giant carved head side of cavern, dumping into the main river. And from the main river into a carved head on the other side. A semi transparent mezzanine made of crystal supported by four ramps from the sides of the river on bothstone sky walkway bridges the main river connecting the two temples. Ramps lead up to the bridge from the docks. There is a large oval dais glowing on the mezzanine.

The whole crew climbs to the mezannine Anna explains. These are the temples of the time gods. "Quick look over there ... hurry!" (not sure why she is pointing away from the closest temple. She tells them some mumbo jumbo about the head dress and Crell. Glancing back over her shoulder from time to time.

Time flows between the gods. One is the temple of the Past and one is the temple of the Future. But which is which? Is the river time flowing out of the future into the past? Or is the river carrying us from the past into the future?

Anna tells them the closest one ... with the river flowing out ... is the temple of the Past. She is sure, but doesn't really explain how she knows -- just that she is the mystic and they have to trust her.

Everyone is looking around. Anna suddenly calls everyone to the opposite side of the ship pointing at heads on the opposite wall. Her excuse seems kind of lame, but they all huddle and follow her. After a moment, she releases them. [Future P&H1 are rolling a barrel into the entrance.]

Instructions on the portals. Stand on the blue crystal and touch the two green crystals to activate the portal. Then, with your hand in the portal, speak aloud where and when you want to go. That simple.

Piggie Hazel and Anna move to examine the writings on the entrance. Anna explains the way it works.

Anna warns them of strangeness/warpness of time – use the portal to your advantage.

Piggie tells them all to get on board and wait. He and Hazel will get the map. Be ready to cast off. He grabs a lit torch and the two head in.

Piggie gives the orders. They will leave Rock in charge and all explore the cave. But Anna cuts a glance at the temple looks back and insists that should be just Piggie and Hazel. [Future P&H2 wave at here and shake heads pointing to just the two of them.]

As soon as they are out of sight, they come running back out yelling with no torch. We have to get out of here now. No time. Cut the lines! The current carries them into the dark tunnel. No torch this time. As soon as they are clear, Piggie gives the order to hoist the sails and they sail away from the island. A few minutes later, they hear a muffled explosion and the cone crumbles into the sea.

What happened? They ask Piggie and Hazel. "For starters, we got the map" he pulls it out. What happened is a long tale. Let's get a koolaid and sit and I'll tell you the rest of the tale.

Crew is skeptical of time travel.

Where is the rest of the map? It'll be here in a few minutes.

Souie! Hazel appears and hands Hazel the blank map.

Here is the tale ...

## First Loop

[Draft (not started)](README.md#the-dancing-boar)
<details><summary>Outline</summary>
River runs out the mouth. More of a channel with high/smooth walls. No way out if you fell in ... have to ride right out of the temple to the main cave -- probably right out of the cave.

River is loud. Glowing crystals light the tunnel, but Piggie keeps his torch. Stone paths on either side of the river. A crystal walkway ledge 20 feet up the wall on both sides. Ramps going up to walkway on both sides. A crystal arch bridge connecting both sides of the river. Rubble on the paths -- boulders fallen from the walls and ceilings over the ages. Must not be anyone around to maintain the place.

Left or right? High or low? They set off on the crystal walkway following the river as it bends around a sharp turn. And a boulder blocks their path. They go back and take the rock path past the bend.

Getting brighter around the curve. Large room with the crystal circle portal shape near the center of the room. River flows through it from a hole in the far wall. The crystal walkway bends and tilts down and meets to form a bridge and landing in the exact center of the giant portal. The crystal portal is 20 feet across. A glowing blue crystal in the center of the landing. A barrel of gunpowder with a long fuse. Wait. Isn't that our gunpowder? Looks just like the barrel I brought? Large stone faces on the walkway facing the portal. They have to step around them.

She said "stand on the blue crystal and touch the glowing green crystals". No sign of green ones. Piggie stands on the crystal and it glows brighter. Two crystals in the head of each stone face glow. "you get that one and I'll get this one". Piggie steps off and all three go dark.

"So nice of you to show up to help me!" John steps out from behind a face with his sword drawn. Walks up and puts the point on Piggie's chest.

Discussion. Surprise that he is the man in black. I got to thinking why not take the whole treasure. But you have that magic map. So I thought I’d just let you do the work and then I’d take it!

#H: What do we do?

#P: Anna said to use the time portal.

#P: So once we figure out how to use the portal, we’ll go back in time to this moment and throw a rock from that ledge up there!

Piggie points. Everyone looks in anticipation, but nothing happens.

John looks back at Piggie and laughs.

#P: [Louder] WE’LL THROW A ROCK AT JOHN FROM UP THERE.

A large rock flies down from up above and hits John perfectly on the hand holding the sword. He yelps in pain and the sword clatters to the floor and bounces over the edge into the river.

#J: Nice shot! But I can use the portal too! Once I have defeated you, I’ll go back in time and throw down a pistol from that ledge!

John hold out his hands and a pistol falls from the ledge right into them. He turns and points the pistol at Hazel.

#J: Now, Piggie, hand over that map or I’ll kill your first mate.

Hazel puts her arms up and looks to Piggie in a panic. Piggie just stands there laughing.

P: Go ahead!

Hazel gasps. John pulls the trigger. The gun snaps but isn’t loaded. John examines the gun in confusion.

P: You are forgetting: only the winners of this battle get to use the portal and go back to throw things down. And we are the winners. We threw the rock — and the unloaded gun! And now, let’s see …

Piggie scratches his chin as he thinks. He snaps his fingers.

P: Ah, I’ve got it. How about a barrel!?

A barrel rolled off the ledge where the gun came from. John reached up to catch it, but the heavy barrel pushed him over the edge into the river. John clung to the barrel as the river swept him away and around the bend.

Hazel1 and Piggie1 popped out from behind a rock on the ledge where the rock had come from.

H1: Nice shot with the barrel, other Hazel!

Hazel2 and Piggie2 popped out from the rubble on the ledge where the barrel came from.

H2: Thanks! And nice shot with the rock, other Hazel!

Hazel looks at Piggie.

H: What‘a going on? Who the heck are they?

P: They must be us … from the future!

The two new sets of Piggies and Hazels made their way down the ramps.

Piggie1 and Hazel1 stop at the pedestal on their side. Hazel2 stops at the pedestal on her side, but Piggie2 continues to the middle and takes the torch from Piggie and goes back to Hazel2. He lights the fuse on the gunpowder. Long fuse. Slow burning.

P2: We’ve got ten minutes until this whole place is a pile of rubble. Piggie — let’s activate the portal.

Piggie stepped on the crystal and it glows. And says:

P: How am I supposed to touch all of these crystals at once?

P2: Luckily, the three of us are the same person!

Piggie2 touches his crystal. Piggie1 touches his.

The portal comes to life. Lots of description here.

P: How are we supposed to get the map from the past and get back to the ship in ten minutes? It took us 20 minutes to get from the ship to here.

Piggie 2 pulls a scroll of paper from his coat and holds it up for them to see.

P2: Hazel and I will get the map back to the ship and get us out of here. You two [he points to P1 and H1] have a rock to throw.

Piggie2 puts his arm in the portal and says something. The portal shimmers and becomes another part of the cave.

Piggie2 and Hazel2 walk confidently through it and out of sight.

Piggie1 and Hazel1 approach the portal. P1 puts in his arm and says something. Another part of the cave appears.

H1 sighs: Here we go again.

They step through and are gone.

P: Well, I guess we go back in time and get the map. Anna said to stick our arms in and saw when/where we wanna go.

Piggie puts in his arm. More description.

“We want to go to the ?name of ship? The night Captain Bacher dies”.

They step through the portal. Describe the feeling.

Trip through the cave. Ruins of some city. Room with balconies on three levels and a dozen doors leading into passages into different directions.

Which one? Does the map say?

Mckraken appears from one of the passages in front of them. That’s what I want to know! Pulls sword.

Anna said to use the portal. We’ll go back and throw a rock from the top level. Nothing happens. I said…

Rock flies down hits sword. Piggie picks it up.

Mckraken: I can use the portal too. If you do that, after I beat you I’ll use the portal drop this gun from above me. Gun falls.

Piggie/hazel laugh. McKraken pulls trigger. Not loaded. Only winners.

Rock hits McKraken. Knocks him out.

Thanks future us! You are welcome. Now this way to the portal.

6 walk down the tunnel. Piggie drops the sword. Another piggie picks it up for him.

There is a keg of gunpowder beside the portal. How did it get there? That’s our powder from the ship? Other set: yeah, I brought it.

Portal room. Voice asks them where/when they want to go.

Piggie from behind walks over to keg and lights fuse. 15 minutes.

You two go throw the rock at McKraken’s sword. “I want to go back to when hazel threw the rock at McKraken’s sword”. Portal shimmers. Two step through

We’ll go get the ship out of here before this blows up. “I want to go to the temple entrance just after we dock”. Before they step through “what do we do?” you have to go get the map. They step through.

Piggie pulls out the map. “I want to go back to when this map was torn in half.” Pulls gun and pistol. Unloaded, but a good bluff. They step through.

Back to the warning scene as they are setting off.

Anna warns them of strangeness ...

</details>

## Mutiny

Piggie and Hazel use the time portal to visit Bacher's ship the night of the mutiny. Red recognizes them. Bacher locks the chest and sets fire to the cabin. He jumps out the window and drowns. Piggie has the key. They get the map, and Hazel travels to the future to get the scribbles on it. They help Red escape. John gets a good look at Piggie and Hazel escaping with the map.

[Draft (not started)](README.md#the-dancing-boar)
<details><summary>Outline</summary>
In the mutiny, Bacher leaves the map in the locked chest but sets fire to the ship. He escapes out the window with the key around his neck and drowns under the weight of his pistols. Red escapes with half the map. Bacher's body

Bacher keeps Red chained in his cabin. Bacher eats and drinks and talks freely about the hidden treasure. He doesn't talk with the crew. He trusts the first mate, Dave McCracken, least of all. McCraken's teenage son, John, serves as Bacher's cabin boy. 

After food and drink, Bacher describes the gold and silver coins and jewels in the buried treasure. But he also describes less valuable items that the old, mad pirate considers priceless. The reader gets no clues about these until the end of the story. 

Bacher retrieves the map from the chest to refresh his drunken memory. Red discovers that the chest has a false bottom. The map is kept there.

Piggie and Hazel show up through the time portal to get the 2nd half of the map. Bacher sets fire to the ship and jumps overboard with the key. The weight of his pistols pulls him under, and he drowns. 

Piggie has the key around his neck. They open the chest before the fire spreads, and Piggie learns of the false bottom where the map is kept. Red pulls a pistol from the chest. It isn't loaded, but Piggie asks to keep it.

The map doesn't have the swirly writing on it. Hazel offers to write it on there, but there is no time with the fire. No time? Sure there is ... they have a time portal. Hazel takes the map into the portal and comes back a second later. The map now has squiggles.

They only need the right half. Red needs to take the left half back to young Piggie and Hazel. Red tears it in half and keeps the left half.

Piggie and Hazel help Red escape and tell him that he'll wash up on an island tomorrow. He should stay there because three days later, Bacher's body washes up with the key.

John McKraken gets a good look at Piggie and Hazel and sees them escape with the map and key into the time portal.

`TODO move to another chapter`

Red returns to his family after being away for a month. Before he was kidnapped, Red would sail to distant ports for food supplies for the pub. He wouldn't take Piggie and Hazel; he wanted to keep them safe.

When he returns from the kidnapping, he takes them on every voyage and teaches them how to sail. He never tells them he met their future selves. He is never worried for their safety because he has seen them grown up. They study the map together and prepare to seek the treasure. Confusingly, the map lists an exact starting date for the adventure -- in just under 10 years. They have that long to prepare!

`TODO Earlier notes`

When you go through the portal, you get a “portal copy” at the destination. It has the same purple shimmering as the portal you stepped through. When you go through the “copy” it closes behind you. We see that happen on the ship in the past. The bad guy watches our heroes return.

Let’s do it this way. They

In the past, they get the full map from Papa red. But it doesn't have any of the notes and pictures on it. Piggie asks Hazel how fast she can write them, but it could take weeks. The ship is burning down around them.

No problem. She takes the rolled up map and walks over to the portal, sticks in her arm, and says something. The she steps into the shimmer and the portal closes. Piggie is a little alarmed to be left behind. But seconds later the portal opens again and Hazel steps back through with the rolled up map in one hand and half a corn fritter in the other.

Piggie: where did you go? And wait ... are you eating?

It's a corn fritter -- you know I can't turn those down. Besides you gave it to me, or rather you will. Anyway, I finished the map.

Rips map in half, etc. Papa red escapes out the window. The bad crew sees them walk through the portal with the map and assumes all is lost.

While they are walking to their next stop, Piggie asks:

Where did you go? He looks at the intricate map half. How long did this take? How long were you gone?

Only a few minutes. I took our portal to when you first activated the temple, but I went to the future side. I took that portal to the future to the point i said (or will say) bring me the map -- later tonight, actually, and dropped it off with myself. I told the portal to take me forward to the moment it was finished and gave it back to myself.

I tried to get the portal to bring me back to you, but it would only go back to the moment I created it -- it wouldn't go back farther.

Piggie: only one direction -- past or future. So how did get back to me?

I told the future portal to take me to 1 minutes before the gunpowder explodes -- which is still in the future. Then I told the past portal to bring me back to the moment I left you.

I'm proud of you, Hazel, you have learned to navigate the river of time!

Later that night they are sitting at the table getting ready to tell them of the adventure.

Paul: you expect us to believe you traveled through time? That's pretty far fetched.

Hazel: is it? Watch this: BRING ME THE MAP

The portal appears, Hazel steps out and hands herself the map then steps back in. End of chapte. "I guess I better get to work marking this up!"

They appear in the captain’s quarters. Repeat a little of the mutinous crew description. Captain has strapped on two pistols, a knife, and a sword. Hazel holding gun (unloaded) piggie with sword drawn.

Never get me treasure. Sets fire to ship. Jumps out window. Sinks. Wait we aren’t.

There is Papa Red. Piggie convinces him they aren’t pirates. See the portal here behind us. I am your …

Etc. See the 00 material.

“I want to go back to the ship as we enter the cave.”

The chest is twice as tall as a regular chest. Looks a bit strange. It has a false bottom and a key hole that the key unlocks. The same with the final chest hiding the gold.

The Captain's body washes up on shore 10 days later. So be sure to stick around. Birds riding the body. The key still around his neck.

tears the map in half.

Hazel's hand writing. No time to jot down all the notes. Just take this half of the map. Later discuss how the letters actually got on the page.

## Second and Third Loops
