# I Love Corn

There was a small dining table in the corner of the pub's kitchen. There were four chairs and four place settings, but rarely did all four of the family sit at the table at once. Violet or Red (often both) worked at the stove stirring pots, turning food in pans, and filling plates to take to the guests. Violet and Red took turns sitting down and eating with the kids.

Six-year-old Hazel and Piggie sat across from each other, waiting for dinner. Papa Red, wearing his white apron and chef's bandana, placed a basket of sliced bread in the middle of the table. He winked at them and headed back to the stove.

"Oh boy, oh boy!" Piggie exclaimed and began squirming in his chair.

Piggie wore his blue "I love corn" shirt that Violet had sewn for him for his birthday. Instead of the word "love," there was a big red heart. Instead of the word "corn," there was a picture of a yellow ear of corn. He tucked his napkin into the neck of the shirt and carefully straightened it to protect the art from any dropped food.

He began singing excitedly, "Do do to-do to-do." He shifted to the right side of his chair to adjust his spoon for the third time, ensuring it was perfectly straight. Then, he shifted to the left to recheck the level of milk in his cup. Finally, he nudged his big shallow bowl to center it on the plate beneath.

Violet joined them at the table with a hot pot from the stove. She ladled a big scoop of thick, steaming vegetable soup into Piggie's bowl.

"Yes! My best favorite!"

In fact, everything placed on Piggie's plate was his favorite. But there were degrees of favorite-ness, like "most favorite" and "best favorite" and the ultimate "most best-est favorite," which was usually reserved for corn.

Violet dipped herself a regular-sized scoop of soup. She gave Hazel just half a scoop and returned the pot to the stove.

Hazel was not particularly fond of vegetables. She sighed sadly at the bowl, sat back dejectedly in her chair, and folded her arms across her chest.

Piggie loved food, but he loved his sister more. Her happiness meant more to him than all the corn in the world. He stopped his excited fidgeting and frowned sadly. He thought for a moment and slowly pushed his cup toward her. "Hazy, you like milk. You can have my milk."

Violet returned to the table with a steaming skillet in one hand. With the other hand, she rubbed Hazel behind the ears. "Remember the fish we had on Wednesday? Piggie saw how much you liked it and asked me to save his piece for you."

Then she added knowingly, "I'm afraid it is a little stale and smelly!"â€” which was exactly how Hazel liked her fish! Violet slid the fish onto Hazel's plate, and Hazel's eyes lit up happily.

"Oh yeah!" Piggie started fidgeting again. "Hazy's most favorite!" He laughed and spooned a large chunk of carrot into his mouth.
