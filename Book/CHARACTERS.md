- Peg leg

John's father was the cabin boy for the old pirate. John's parents were killed on one of the old pirate's raids, but the pirate spared John's father and raised him on the ship. John's father was there when the mutiny took place. He saw the open portal and Piggie/Hazel escaping.


He lost an eye and a leg when that ship sank.


John moved to live in the town with Papa Red hoping for clues to the treasure. He recognized Hazel and Piggie as they grew up. He's been waiting for them to after the treasure.
