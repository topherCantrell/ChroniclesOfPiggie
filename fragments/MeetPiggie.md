After the Scaring Hazel post ...

Hazel and I are on the computer now. That seems like a strange phrase, doesn't it: "on the computer". Except in my case, it's true. I am literally standing with my front two feet on the ‘f' and ‘j' keys. Hazel is sitting on the desk beside me. Wow, this cat is fat. She barely fits on the desk, and her legs are dangling off into the air. In the rare moments she does wake up, she'll follow the mouse pointer around the screen. I usually open kitten videos for her and play them in a window down in the corner of the monitor by her.

I just updated my facebook page with photos from last night. It was Halloween, and Daddy dressed me up like a mummy! He wrapped toilet paper around me, but not too much and not too tight. Last time I tried that, I got scared being all bound up with my eyes covered.

Our house is in a neighborhood with only a few houses, and all the houses are on the hill with long driveways. It just isn't worth it to the kids to climb those hills for a few pieces of candy - especially in a heavy, elaborate costume. They end up burning off more calories than they get in candy. Trust me. I know about short legs and tall hills. I wouldn't trick-or-treat here either.

Except that I did! Daddy took me out on the porch, and I rang the bell with my nose. Momie swore she couldn't figure out who I was, but I know that she really knew. It was still fun to play along. I got one single mini Kitt Katt bar.

I'm sure you got more than that but remember I'm only eight inches long. How would you like to have a candy bar half as tall as you?! I'll be eating on this chocolate monster long after you are done with your candy.

The UPS man just rang the doorbell. He left a huge box on the porch. Well, it's huge to me. I know what it is because I watch Daddy order it last week. It's a Fisher-Price Chatter Phone. It's a seven-dollar toy for babies. It's shaped like an old rotary phone with wheels and a face on the front. He told Momie he is going to put motors in it and drive it around. 

He's always doing weird projects like this ... last year it was a Farmer Says. He pulled out all the insides and replaced them with a computer board that plays sounds from the internet. It is amazing how he takes a ten-dollar toy, adds fifty dollars worth of computer gadgets, spends 40 hours programming the thing, and ends up with a more expensive, less fun toy.
What he doesn't know is that tomorrow I'll be riding the toy up and down the hall while Hazel plays in the box it came in.
