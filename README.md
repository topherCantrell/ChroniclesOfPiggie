# The Chronicles of Piggie
Piggie and I are still planning the novel. Here are some scenes ready for the first draft. Click on the
headings below to read the manuscript.

### [The Wooden Crate](Book/WoodenCrate.md)
This is the first scene in the story chronilogically, though it appears in the book
later as a flashback. The reader is familiar with the setting and characters, but this
scene shows how Piggie and Hazel came to live with Papa Red and Violet.

### [I Love Corn](Book/ILoveCorn.md)
Piggie and Hazel are six. The reader sees how much Piggie loves his sister (hint: more than corn). 
The reader sees that Piggie sacrifices for her to be happy.
