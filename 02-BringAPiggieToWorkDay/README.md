First for some gas. I guess I'll have to pump it.

We ate lunch at the Chinese Buffet. The owner lady kept asking me to go back to the kitchen, but I never went.

I got to meet Dad's friend, Russ. He's a cool guy. He plays guitar in a rock band!

Back to work, but I'm going to try out a management role.
