### May 6, 2023

This is my brother, Walter (in the box). Back in December 22, I helped him pack up and move to sunny Los Angeles to live with my Aunt Susan and the rest of the Uttings.

He's been having a blast out there in sunny California. He sent me an excerpt from his own adventures. Here is what he (and Susan and Sophie) have been up to:

I just love a good lunch out. The food, the ambience, the intellectual conversations…

I couldn’t decide between iced tea and lemonade, so Mom ordered something called an “Arnold Palmer” Yummy!

I totally pigged out on the corn bread muffins!

And the fried green tomatoes!

And I went hog-wild over the catfish and collard greens

I wasn’t sure about the steamed cabbage, but I was persuaded to try a bite. Not bad!

Afterwards, we went shopping…

I got in a little trouble for playing hide and seek, but I just couldn’t resist!

Mom was getting mad, so I tried to run away

But she was too fast for me!

Sophie tried to help me get-away on this ridiculous little bicycle.

Then I decided this tank was way more my style!

All the excitement was wearing me out, so I decided to lay down for an afternoon nap.

But not before stopping to smell the roses. What an adventure!
