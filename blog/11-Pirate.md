'twas the 19th o' September in the year 2023. As the sun climbed o'er the horizon, I scaled the ladder t' the helm o' me ship. I took in a long, deep breath o' the dry, mornin' air 'n slowly exhaled o'er me chin t' dry the breakfast ale from me beard.

Chris: What? We were drinking orange juice on the porch ...

Arrr, dear reader. Chris be me first mate, and he be a bit gusty of tongue. This be my story, matey. I'll tell her my own way. 

I'd hang ye from a yardarm, but ye'd break the mast, ye grog-shy, bloomin' cockroach! ... Avast!

Chris: OK, OK. But ease up a bit on the English-to-Pirate online translator/insulter.

Aye! That be a good idea, lad.

Now where was I? Oh yes. September 19, 2023. The most famous holiday of inspiring pirates all around the world! It be International Talk Like a Pirate Day! (google it)
