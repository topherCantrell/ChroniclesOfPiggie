Hear the thunder and rain (really just Alexa). See the wind blowing the curtains (really just the fan).

Tonight we have a particularly good cover cave.

Come on back into the cave and warm yourself by the campfire (really an LED candle).

In the back you can see a foot. Sometimes I bite a toe

No animals live in this cave, except for my friend nibbles. Cut the cheeze. I'm not sure where he goes ... one of the many small tunnels at the back of the cave on the other side of that big foot. Don't bite those toes! I did one time, and woke the monster that lives on the other side of that wall. The SLEEP monster. You don't want to wake that thing up, trust me. Stay on this side of the cave away from that wall. See the wall kind of flexing. That's the SLEEP monster breathing. If it catches you, it puts you to sleep. We don't want that!

Help yourself to the snacks. Free crackers from Jason's Deli. Don't worry about crumbs. Nibbles will get them.

Important mission: guard the treasure! Not money or jewels -- Mom's red fuzzy socks she wears when it is cold in the night.

Let's peek out (this is when the reader realizes what things are outside.) A hand reaches from the cave wall and pulls piggie in to snuggle. "Night night time, Piggie". OH NO! The sleep monster has me! It's pulling me through the cover to snuggle! Now that I think about it, I really am very tired. It's been a long day. Guard the treasure for me and keep the fire going.
