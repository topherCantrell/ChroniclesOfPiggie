It's spring, and that means Critters!

We love feeding and watching the birds, so we ordered this excellent solar-powered camera bird feeder. The BirdBuddy! The boxes came in the mail today. Time to unpack everything.

Oh, yes, Mr. T - good call. We should take a break and make a box fort.

Much assembly is required. Watch your back, everyone; Nibbles found the stickers. Seriously, Mr. T. He'll put a sticker on your back when you aren't looking, and you'll have a hard time pulling it off with those little arms.

Let's test this thing. Everyone: act like a bird looking for a snack. Cheep. Cheep.

We bought some bird food from Walmart. Seeds and MEALWORMS? Yuck! But I guess the birds like this stuff.

The bird feeder is on a squirrel-proof pole, and the cute little squirrels hang out beneath it, waiting for a tasty morsel to fall.

I didn't want the squirrels to feel left out, so we headed back to Walmart. We bought this cute squirrel feeder shaped like a picnic table. And we got squirrel food.

It turns out the squirrels and I have something in common: we all love corn! Look at Nibbles go. He's already cleaned his end of the cob. We may have to rename him "Bites."

We also bought a nutritious blend of food for the squirrels. We'll put this in the picnic table feeder.

Oh, yeah! We have our first customer! We see this guy a lot. He likes to walk along the stair railing and gnaw on the newel post.

Nibbles, Mr. T: check out these table manners. You two should take notes and ...

... no. Nope. I spoke too soon.

All this critter-feeding has made me hungry. Come on, boys. Let's dig into the popcorn Mom got us. Ahhh! Truffles and corn - my two favoritest flavors!
